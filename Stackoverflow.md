# Learning a new library the intense way
- sometime ago i wanted to learn working with the DT package.
- After getting the basics with a few tutorials - i decided to try a fast track
-- real live examples
-- learn from the best
-- get efficient / fast

Looked up top answerer of DT questions on #SO. 
- Looked at the questions they answered and tried them myself without looking at solution.
- If i couldnt answer enough and saw a pattern, back to tutorials
- compare my solution to top answerer and adapt my approaches

After i could answer around 75%+ and/or ran out of examples i tried new questions coming in
Step 1) Answer them and compare with new answers
Step 2) Racing with other users for best / fastest answer.

Step 2) can be demoralizing as a new be in a field not always most welcoming :).

If you are good enough to race with other users on #SO on real live examples for best/fastest 
answer, you will be efficient applying the library in future use cases.
If not go back to tutorials / top user answers and repeat the process until you are.
